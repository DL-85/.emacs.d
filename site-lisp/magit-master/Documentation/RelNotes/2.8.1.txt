Magit v2.8.1 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Fixes since v2.8.0
------------------

* Command `magit-list-repositories' failed on empty git repositories.

* The Git variable `pull.rebase' was ignored when determining whether
  the current branch is being rebased onto its upstream in order to
  display that information in the status buffer.
